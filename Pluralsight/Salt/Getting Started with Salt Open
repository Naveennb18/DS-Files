IAAC (Infrastructure As A Code)

  - Automating the configuration, deployment and maintenance of business critical infrastructure through files that define an intended state of
    a collection of servers and other IT infrastructure instead of human readable checklist to configure and deploy new servers

Salt Architecture:

  - salt-master

    - Master control Program
    - Each device manage by the master runs a process called salt-minion
    - Typically a master can handle 700 minions to 1000s

  - salt-minion

    - Receives all instructions and configuration information from the salt-master through an authenticated and encrypted communication link (authorized_keys)

salt-ssh Architecture:

  - salt-ssh is a powerful tool can even be used to install salt-minion with salt automation
  - Salt is an agent based system
  - salt only requires open ports on the Master

- Accessive network latency or conjunction between the master and minions can reduce the reliability of control response messages.
- Minions spread across multiple global datacenters, it may be helpful to use a salt-proxy in each remote location called a "salt syndic server"(Proxy Master)
- In some cases simply adjusting the timeout parameters on the master may overcome these limitations.
- when using salt to manage a fleet of remote or IoT devices, syndic is not recommended. In this case a longer timeouts are better solutions.
- When using any configuration management tools we have highly privileged access to the target systems.
- Security certificates and keys are exchanged when setting up Minions.

Public key cryptography:

  - Public key cryptography is a method used by TLS(Transport Layer Security - is an encryption protocol that protects internet communications) to establish
    HTTPS and many other types of secure connections requires an identical shared secret key to encrypt and decrypt messages efficiently.

  - Identical Symmetric Keys:
    - Session Encryption uses Symmetric cryptography where both the sender and the receiver uses the same secret key to encrypted and decrypt confidential information.

  - Asymmetric Key Pair:
    - Public key cryptography required more computation but it breaks a key into two pieces which are called Asymmetric Keys.
    - One to encrypt and another for decrypt the message and is mathematically impractical to derive one key from another.
    - It allows one way private conversation. So, combining two sets of keys enables a message to be encrypted in both directions
    - One of the key is kept as private and the other is provided to the end of the connection where one key is used to encrypt the data and other is required to decrypt it

  - Master has the private key that only the minions who have the other half of the key can decrypt
  - If the master doesn't have the correct key, it will fail the verification and the minion refuses to connect and provides a warning.
  - Similarly, the Minions each generates a private key during initial setup and the master has the copy of other half allowing the master
    to verify that each minion is authorised and not being impersonated.
  - The master will not accept connection from any minions that have not been previously accepted
  - The asymmetric encryption keys are used to setup a temporary set of identical or symmetric encryption keys.
  - These temporary keys are identical and shared by both ends of the link, encrypting and decrypting data with symmetric keys is faster and more efficient
    than with a similarly strong asymmetric key set.
  - After key acceptance, traffic is fully authenticated and encrypted protecting all salt activities.

  - Signing Certificates:
    - Salt provides master key signatures on minions and minion key signatures on master which allows to verify each device manually to avoid middle attacks
    - If security not required, we can also enable auto-accept minion key from Master

Migration and Scaling:

  - IT infrastructure maintenance tasks

    - Servers, Network gear

  - Network overload

    - More traffic is on the way

  - Just duplicating the server won't scale
  - Prepare to move to the cloud

First step with the salt:

  - Offline minions will not receive the commands unless they are re-run on the master when the minion is online
  - "salt-call" runs in the context of the user who runs it
  - If the minions run as a non-root user, it needs elevated privileges for most system administration tasks
  - The Master can also be a minion

File management and Modules:

  - "salt-cp" enables a quick copy of files or directories of files to minions

    - Example:

      Master:

        user@master: ~ $ touch testfile
        user@master: ~ $ sudo salt-cp 'minion01' testfile /home/user1/testfile

      Minion:

        user1@minion: ~ $ ls test*
        testfile

  - "salt-cp" is not ideal for larger files (>1MB)
  - Don't use "salt-cp" to copy security -sensitive files
  - We can create our own custom modules in Python or Cython if a buil-in module is not available

    - Example:

      $ sudo salt minion-name cloud.create my-ec2-config myinstance image=ami-1248fca2 size='t1.micro' ssh_username=ec2-user securitygroup=default delvol_on_destroy=True

      - Here, in the above example, "cloud.create", creates VMs on AWS.

  - Here are some example salt modules

    - Databases
    - System Monitoring
    - User Management
    - Filesystem Management
    - Cron Jobs
    - Virtualization

  - The two most used modules are actually "Virtual Modules". They are:

    - Package Module : Manage software installations, removal, updates
    - Service Module: Enables, disables, starts and stops services

    - Example:

      Master:

        user@master: ~ $ sudo salt '*' system.poweroff

          - The above command will shutdown all the minions which are connected to the master
